__*GfK Front End Code Challenge*__

__*NOTES FOR REVIEW*__
Things I would do if more time spent on task:

- Implement unit tests and e2e tests
- Add PostCSS to use nested selectors, etc.
- Move data to selectors using reselect
- Fix  reload of search page if viewer is searching new people on same page
- Use prettier for code cleanliness and to conform to a standard

__*Scenario*__

You have been recently hired as a senior developer on a startup that is trying to build a web application using GitHub's search API. There are concerns over the quality of the existing codebase; moreover, your architect has decided that the application should use [GitHub's GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/) instead of its REST API in future.

*Please submit your solution once you deem it production ready.*

Your first ticket is as follows:
